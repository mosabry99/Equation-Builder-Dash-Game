# Feature Implementation Summary

## ðŸ”Š Audio System Implementation

### Created: `lib/managers/audio_manager.dart`

**Features:**
- âœ… Singleton pattern for global audio management
- âœ… Flame Audio integration
- âœ… Pre-loading of audio files for better performance
- âœ… Respects user settings (sound effects & background music toggles)
- âœ… Error handling for missing audio files

**Sound Effects:**
- `playCollectSound()` - Plays when collecting numbers/operators
- `playCorrectSound()` - Plays when equation is correct
- `playWrongSound()` - Plays when equation is wrong
- `playClickSound()` - UI click sound
- `playBackgroundMusic()` - Background music loop

**Integration:**
- Automatically initializes in `EquationBuilderGame.onLoad()`
- Triggers sounds on game events (collect, success, failure)
- Uses audio files from `assets/audio/` folder

## ðŸŽ® Touch Controls Implementation

### Replaced Keyboard Controls

**Before:**
- Arrow keys to move left/right
- Space/Enter to submit equation
- Backspace to delete

**After:**
- âœ… **Tap left half of screen** â†’ Move player left
- âœ… **Tap right half of screen** â†’ Move player right
- âœ… Simple, intuitive mobile controls

**Implementation:**
```dart
@override
void onTapDown(TapDownInfo info) {
  final tapX = info.eventPosition.global.x;
  final screenWidth = size.x;
  
  if (tapX < screenWidth / 2) {
    player.moveLeft();
  } else {
    player.moveRight();
  }
}
```

**Changes:**
- Removed `KeyboardEvents` mixin from game
- Removed `onKeyEvent()` handler
- Added touch-based controls via `onTapDown()`
- Updated settings screen to reflect touch-only controls
